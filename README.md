## Hi there, I’m Jandro! 👋
Welcome to the digital playground of a software engineer who believes in pushing the limits of code and cloud. If you're looking for innovative ideas, frameworks that make your life easier, or just some good ol' tech talk, you're in the right place.
- 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Mastering cloud tech while experimenting with cutting-edge frameworks. If it’s scalable, efficient, or futuristic, I’m all in.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** From containers to Kubernetes, and everything in between. I’m diving into the depths of cloud architecture, always chasing that next level of efficiency.
- 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Bold projects that aim to disrupt, whether it’s in the world of software frameworks, cloud optimization, or building the future of dev tools. Let’s make magic happen.
- 🤔 **I’m looking for help with:** Anything related to CI/CD pipelines, DevOps, or scaling systems to meet the needs of a global user base. Got some pro tips? Hit me up.
- 💬 **Ask me about:** Anything! From the latest frameworks, cloud platforms, to my never-ending obsession with optimization. Or just hit me with a *Big Bang Theory* reference — I’m down for nerdy banter anytime.
- 📫 **How to reach me:** Drop me a message right here on GitHub, or catch me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or anywhere in the cloud (you know, metaphorically speaking).
- 😄 **Pronouns:** He/Him
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I don’t just code — I experiment. Whether it’s a new programming language or a DIY tech project, I’m always tinkering with something. Also, I can probably talk about software engineering for hours (and I do).
